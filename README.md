# Enlightened-Perl-Organisation Conference Video

A repository to document, track, and share details of the EPO Conference Video initiative - offering high quality video recording and streaming equipment for use at Perl (and potentially other) workshops throughout Europe.

You can find details of the [equipment and setup](/equipment/README.md), OBS [software](/obs/README.md) resources, and [tips](/tips/README.md) within this repository. The issue tracker should be used for wishlist items as well as tracking problems with any of the equipment.

## History

Making high quality recordings of conference presentations can be expensive and time consuming - large conferences will usually have a budget for this, which can be in the region of several thousand Euros or significantly more. The recording service is usually outsourced, but there is a good guarantee that the resultant recordings will be of high quality.

For smaller workshops it has usually been the case of finding a cheap video recording device to capture the speaker and slides and then placing it such that the recording is "good enough". There are often problems with this - it is difficult to capture speaker and slides in a single frame, sound quality can be very bad if the room is big, it's difficult to fix/edit the recordings after capture depending on the device, for portable devices the recording time/space is restricted and/or limited, and so on.

### London Perl Workshop 2017

At [LPW 2017](https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2017/) the organisers decided to spend a large part of the budget on purchasing new video equipment to record the talks. As LPW is usually a multi-track event there was a requirement to purchase three sets of each. It was felt that this was a good investment as the equipment would allow higher quality recordings of talks and could be used at future LPW and [London Perl Mongers](http://london.pm.org/) events.

The equipment included high quality consumer grade cameras with microphone input ports, wireless microphones, various adapters, cables, and accessories. The only thing we did not purchase were screen capture devices due to budget constraints, but a set of these was sourced for the workshop. The resultant recordings were much improved over previous years, although did require some post processing/editing.

### Editing Time Sink

A conservative estimate for this type of content is that for every hour of video you record it will require two hours of editing time. That is if there are no problems with the recording that require fixing: importing the files, watching through the video, exporting the video (rendering). Should there be problems with video/sound then the amount of editing time can increase significantly.

At LPW the three talk tracks resulted in approx 18 hours of recordings (3 x 6 hours). This would required approximately 36 hours of editing time, however the nature of the capture meant that pieces had to be put together and that increased the editing time significantly. There was also a problem with the wireless microphones meaning the sound had to be fixed.

While we were happy with the final videos, we realised that the investment in time to edit the recordings was still a significant cost in both time and funding.

### The Perl Conference in Glasgow 2018

For The Perl Conference in Glasgow the EPO, who were involved in the organisation, asked if they could take the kits from LPW and expand them. The LPW organisers were happy for this to happen, and felt that this could result in much better kits that would further improve the recording quality as well as reduce the time required for editing the recordings prior to upload.

The organisers of TPC expanded the kits to include better wireless microphones, more adapters, more cables, a multi input/ouput switch board, and a desktop PC. The desktop PC included OBS software that would allow combining multiple input sources and the use of overlays - this would effectively remove any need for post processing / editing, assuming no significant technical problems, and also allow live streaming of the recordings.

All 3 rooms were live streamed to YouTube, and a Raspberry Pi was used as a control console so that the stream could pause between talks and have something displayed. ACT (via an API) was used to grab talk titles and details to do the now and next live text for each room.
