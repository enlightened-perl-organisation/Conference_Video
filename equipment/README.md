## Equipment Setup

### Room Setup

The basic room setup should look similar to the following diagram, taking into account size of the actual room and location of doors etc:

![room setup](/equipment/room_setup.png)

The basic plan is to have the camera near the back of the room, near to the PC setup. Having the camera off to the left or right is also OK, making sure that if the speaker is standing behind the lectern, that they are on average looking towards the camera. This means putting the camera on the opposite side of the Attendees to the lectern.

If there is only one block of Attendees, it would be best to keep the camera and lectern on opposite sides of the Attendees.

### PC Setup

The PC Should be setup close to the Camera, allowing for one person to manage both if required. Run the power cable to the desk you are using, then wire up the Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor (if disconnected) and Ethernet. Confirm with the venue where the correct Network connection port is, then run the Ethernet cable to this, and tape down the power cable and Ethernet cable.

Connect the two Capture cards to the USB 3 ports on the PC, then turn on. Login username and password for the machine (and the NodeCG setup) will be provided at the event.

Log in to the PC, then start OBS and a browser, navigating to the NodeCG dashboard. See the OBS Setup section if this has not been setup yet.

### Camera Setup

The Camera should be setup close to the PC, but with enough room around it to pan the camera around if required. Set up the Tripod as tall as possible, and run the extension lead to the Tripod. Affix the extension lead to the Tripod, then mount the Camera to the Tripod. Attach the battery, power, and insert an SD card, and then turn on the camera. Connect the 5M HDMI Cable from the camera to one of the Capture Cards on the PC.

### Microphone Setup

The microphone base station should be set up near to the camera, on the desk for the PC. Connect the power to the base station, then connect the base station to the camera using the 1/4" to 3.5mm cable.

Insert a fresh battery into the belt pack and connect the microphone to the pack. Turn on the base station and the belt pack, and check on the Camera microphone levels that you are receiving sound, and that when talking at a 'presentation level' the levels are not ending up in the red. Place the Belt Pack on the lectern ready for the presenter to wear.

### Lectern Setup

At the lectern there will be a large amount of cables. These should be kept as tidy as possible. Run an extension lead over to the lectern, and plug in the HDMI Splitter and Switch. Connect the output of the Switch to the input of the Splitter, and connect one of the outputs of the Splitter to the Projectors HDMI input. Connect the 25m HDMI cable to the Splitter and then run the cable over to the recording PC, and tape down the cable. If possible, keep some slack at either end of the cable. Connect a HDMI lead for normal HDMI input to the Switch, and then connect an other HDMI lead from the VGA to HDMI adapter to the Switch.

## Pre Talk Setup

This set of setups should be checked or performed before every talk.
