This directory contains the configuration and overlays for use in OBS.

Create a directory for your workshop and add files as necessary. See previous workshop directories for figuring out the setup.

There is also a base overlay file here, which you can use to take as a template for adding sponsors and logs if you just want a very simple setup.

## Live Streaming
