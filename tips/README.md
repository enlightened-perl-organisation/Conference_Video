Here is a list of general hints and tips for various parts of the recording process that we have learned. Feel free to add to this list

## Equipment Setup

Duct tape the computer power source to the wall to dissuade anyone from unplugging it

## OBS Setup, Configuration, and Use

When recording the audio in OBS add a gain filter and set it to +5 or so d.b. - you can then use the volume control on the mixer to increase the volume for quieter speakers and reduce it for louder speakers.

You can stop the capture to HD without interrupting the streaming

After capturing each talk to the HD, and having the stopped the capture, rename the files as they default to the timestamp; this is useful but having part of the title in the filename as well is better

## For Individual Speakers

Newer (and potentially all) MacBooks do not like metal frames on lecterns as their insulation is not sufficient to prevent electrical feedback that then affects the output to the projector/capture - try to isolate the case of the Macbook from any metal (using a pencil works).

Check any speakers haven’t muted the mic or if they did they remember to put it back off mute

Ask speakers to remember to repeat questions/comments for the recording.

Ask speakers to remember to return any converters they use from the kit.

## Lightning Talks

For lightning talks just attach the microphone to the lectern so you don’t have faff about.

## Technical Problems During Talks

If something isn't working the first check should be « is it plugged in » - especially when using adapters/converters/dongles that have less than flush fits
